                        <p>An economy can not thrive without jobs. That's exactly why I plan to insure that everybody who wishes to posses one, will be able to get a job in Vita Nova.</p>
                        <p>This will happen by giving headway to small business to safely open their doors (virtually) and be able hire people to be able to get their business off the ground and boost it to the stars and beyond.</p>
                        <h2>Large corporations</h2>
                        <p>In addition to helping small business, large corporations are also a large part of any nation's economy. That's why I plan to open Vita Nova's arms to accept large corporations, whilst still regulating them to insure they do not create a monopoly, destroying family owner opperations</p>
