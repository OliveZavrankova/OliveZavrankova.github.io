                        <p>Humans are made to learn, however many country's ways of teaching are far outdated. I plan to have Vita Novian students learn in a way that's made for today, not yesterday.</p>
                        <h2>Today's world</h2>
                        <p>Learning today involves learning how to use modern technology, and modern theories. During my time in office, I will work tirelessly to show to the people that there is a modern way to learn. One that doesn't require a child to sit down for seven hours a day. A way that let's children learn a mix of what they want, and teach them what they need to know.</p>

                        <p>Despite not having physical buildings, that doesn't mean that our citizens are not learning every single day. Many will begin learning our second national language, and I will make it my goal to insure that it's taught to those who want to learn it properly, and in a manner that best helps them.</p>
