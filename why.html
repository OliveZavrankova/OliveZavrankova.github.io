                        <p>There are many well qualified candidates this election, so why vote for me? I've been working for Vita Nova's national government for one year, and have been able to quickly clime the ladder. Throughout my time, I've been able to meet many amazing people, and have gotten to work closely with the 13 Founders and the nation's first Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Throughout my time, I've created many things such as the federal government's website, a national language, a national bank, an economic opening plan, the House of Lawmakers, and much more. In doing this, I have learned the inner workings of Vita Nova, and am able to handle anything that may come my way. I am more than capable to handle the large responsibility that comes with being Prime Minister.</p>
                        <h2>My education</h2>
                        <p>I have spent most of my middle and high school days studying history and politics. I have taken classes in advanced government and economics, AP European history, and more. Additionally, I plan to major in political science once I enter university.</p>
                        <figure class="figure"></figure>
                        <p>I am also well versed in being able to communicate with people in a calm and professional manner. I am trilingual, and able to fluently speak in English, Bulgarian, and Macedonian. In addition to this, I am currently learning French and Russian, creating Vitnovski, and planning to learn more languages in the feature.</p>
